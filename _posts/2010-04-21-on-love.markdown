By [Kahlil Gibran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahlil_Gibran)

```
When love beckons to you follow him,
Though his ways are hard and steep. 
And when his wings enfold you yield to him, 
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. 
And when he speaks to you believe in him, 
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.

For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.
Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. 
Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, 
So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. 
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. 
He sifts you to free you from your husks. 
He grinds you to whiteness. 
He kneads you until you are pliant; 
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.
All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart,
and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.

But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, 
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, 
Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, 
and weep, but not all of your tears.

Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; 
For love is sufficient unto love.

When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," 
but rather, I am in the heart of God." 
And think not you can direct the course of love, 
if it finds you worthy, directs your course. Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. 

But if you love and must needs have desires, 
let these be your desires: 
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
To know the pain of too much tenderness. 
To be wounded by your own understanding of love; 
And to bleed willingly and joyfully. 
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;
To return home at eventide with gratitude; 
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.


当爱向你招手，那就跟他去吧，尽管一路上难免艰难崎岖。
当他用双翼将你拥抱，就服从他吧，虽然他翅下隐藏的剑可能会伤到你。
要是他对你说话了，就相信他吧，即使他的话语或许会将你的梦粉碎，就象北风会使花园化成荒芜。
因为要是爱会将你加冕为王，他也能将你迫害至死。假如他能叫你成长，他也可能将你剪除。
假如他会登到与你一样的高度去爱抚你那在阳光下娇颤的柔嫩枝叶，
那他也可能下降到你的脚跟并动摇他们对土地的依附。
他会将你如玉米一样成捆地收集，并将你反复地打击，使你裸露出来，
然后将你从你的外壳中筛选出来，再把你碾磨得白白的，最后还要把你不断地揉捏，直到你变得驯从。
接下来他会将你放在祭祀的火旁，那样你将成为献给上帝的圣餐里的面饼。
然而你要是害怕了，只想在追寻爱的宁静与快活。
那么你最好掩盖好你的赤裸，远离爱的激烈颠簸的世界吧，
到那没有四季冷热之分的世界去，在那里你可以大笑，却不完全表达你的笑声；
你可以大哭，却不会用尽你的泪水。
除了其本身，爱一无所求，也不能给予任何东西。
爱一无所有，也不被任何东西占有。因为爱有了自身就已经足够了。
当你爱了，请不要说“上帝在我心里了”，你应当说：“我在上帝的心里了”。
也不要想着你能引导爱的进程，若你是值得的，爱会引导你们的进展。
爱除了使自己圆满之外别无所求。
当你要是爱了，又必定有所渴求。
那就请让这些成为你的渴求吧：渴望着能融化为一条奔腾的小溪，对着夜晚唱起欢快的歌。
渴望着能体会到太痴情将带来的痛楚。
渴望着能被自己对爱的理解而受伤，并且心甘情愿地为此流血。
祈求在黎明带着飞一般的心情醒来，并感谢还有可爱的日子。
祈求在午休的时刻里能体会爱所带来的心悦神怡。
祈求在傍晚带着感恩的心情归家，然后在临睡的时候，为心爱的人祈祷，并咏诵那美妙的赞歌。
